- use SDL_COLOR to initialize colors instead of reading directly from array
- potentially pass pointer to sdl instance instead of passing directly for
    drawing functions
- X Make directories for source files, includes
- X Rework Makefile to use source file dir, include dir

To research:
- static const & const variables
- linking and libraries
- is it ok to do math with floats when initializing int?
- is it OK to return a pointer from a function instead of passing a pointer
and initializing variables? won't the stack be erased?

Edge cases:
- what if no walls provided in map? And we check ray until we 'hit' a wall?

Notes:
- Even SDL_RenderClear() can return an error, but in examples it doesn't seem
 to be checked: https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_RenderClear
- Mallocing a multidimensional array may be better than declaring static,
it just looks complicated; go for static first and then do malloc when
refactoring
